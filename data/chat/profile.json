    "I'm a software engineer from Chicago, IL USA. I graduated from Iowa State University in May 2021, with a B.S. in Software Engineering 📚. Over the years I've found many passions, from animation, graphic design, and writing music, to full stack web development. I think the common theme here is that I love to make things 🧑‍🎨."
