1. Go through the codebase and deeply analyze:

- How to get started, commands, dev set up
- prod deployment, workflows, system architecture, infrastructure
  - open next configuration and CDK design
- Features
  - for complex features: feature system diagrams, feature architecture
- Testing, evals, testing against fixtures vs. real API
- available configuration, data setup, data preprocessing
- environment and secrets values handlings

2. Create README.md for root level and every package

3. Create a single root level structured docs folder with markdown formatted documentation and embedded .png diagrams where appropriate. Docs should be grouped in multiple ways:

- Setup, deployments, CI/CD
- Infra/System Design
- Features
- Configuration

Use your best judgement as to how to handle the directory tree
