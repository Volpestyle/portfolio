```
Short answer: I’ve built native and hybrid mobile stuff. Notably:

- ilikeyacut — a native iOS app (Swift) that uses Gemini’s Flash Image 2.5 nano-banana model with a serverless Go/AWS Lambda backend for realtime virtual hairstyle try-on (personal side project).
- Lowe’s Returns Android app work — at Lowe’s I led adoption of a micro-frontend architecture and implemented UX flows using React + Ionic + Capacitor for the Returns Android app, and I built a Node.js + Fastify BFF that powers the Android and web apps.

If you want, I can: 1) share architecture notes for ilikeyacut (client ↔ serverless flow), 2) show examples of the Ionic/Capacitor micro-frontend setup I used at Lowe’s, or 3) drop sample Swift or Ionic snippets. Which do you want?
```
