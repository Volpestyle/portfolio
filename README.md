## About

A [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) 15 project using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Running Locally

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Project knowledge cache

The chatbot relies on precomputed summaries + embeddings stored under `generated/`.

1. Make sure `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `PORTFOLIO_GIST_ID`, and `OPENAI_API_KEY` are set.
2. Run:

```bash
pnpm generate:projects
```

This script fetches the latest READMEs, asks OpenAI for short summaries/tags, builds embeddings, and writes them to:

- `generated/repo-summaries.json`
- `generated/repo-embeddings.json`

Commit those files so Amplify can ship them without extra infra. Re-run whenever you update repos or READMEs.
