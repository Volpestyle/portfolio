(MongoDB, Express JS, Angular, Node JS)\n## Description\nAudio engineers at NPR like to keep track of all technical difficulties that are encountered during production. Before my\ntime at NPR, the system in place to log incidents was running on an outdated tech-stack and wasn't as elegant as many of the users would have liked. During my internship, it was my job to update and redesign this system to be more capable and user-friendly.\n\nSome of the main features included:\n- Automatic account creation for NPR employees.\n- Searching for logs that fit various criteria.\n- Log creation.\n- Personal subscriptions that send email or text notifications to a specific user when a log that fits certain critiera is submitted.\n- Global subscription that many users can subscribe to at once\n- Automatic I.T. ticket creation.\n- User roles (Administrative abilites, ability to create global subscription, etc.)\n\nThe full documentation of my implementation that I shared with my team can be found in pdf form inside this repo. (It was written in Confluence and upon \nexport has experienced some small formatting errors)\n\n## Screenshots\n![search](/screenshots/AED-sheets_screenshot1.png)\n![profile](/screenshots/AED-sheets_screenshot2.png)\n![manage lookups](/screenshots/AED-sheets_screenshot3.png)",

This repository is a pnpm workspace containing:\n\n- `@jobseek/app`: the Next.js 15 application (app router) and API routes\n- `@jobseek/cdk`: infrastructure-as-code for backend and app deployment\n\nFor deeper details (architecture, auth, deployment, rate limiting), see the documents in `docs/` linked below.\n\n## Quick start\n\n- Install dependencies\n  ```bash\n  pnpm install\n  ```\n- Run the app locally\n  ```bash\n  pnpm dev\n  ```\n- Lint, build, and start\n  ```bash\n  pnpm lint\n  pnpm build\n  pnpm start\n  ```\n\nPrerequisites: Node.js 20+ and pnpm installed. Environment variables and service configuration are covered in the deployment guide.\n\n## Workspace layout\n\n- `app/` — Next.js app and API routes\n- `components/`, `hooks/`, `contexts/`, `lib/` — shared UI, hooks, context, utilities\n- `cdk/` — AWS CDK project (stacks, scripts, deployment helpers)\n- `docs/` — reference documentation\n- `public/`, `styles` (via `app/globals.css`) — assets and global styles\n\n## Infrastructure and deployment (CDK)\n\nCommon commands are exposed at the root for convenience and delegate to `@jobseek/cdk`:\n\n- Synthesize and diff\n  ```bash\n  pnpm cdk:synth\n  pnpm cdk:diff\n  ```\n- Deploy backend (all environments)\n  ```bash\n  pnpm deploy:backend:dev\n  pnpm deploy:backend:staging\n  pnpm deploy:backend:prod\n  ```\n- Deploy Next.js hosting (all environments)\n  ```bash\n  pnpm deploy:nextjs:dev\n  pnpm deploy:nextjs:staging\n  pnpm deploy:nextjs:prod\n  ```\n\nYou can also run any CDK scripts directly within the `cdk/` package:\n\n```bash\npnpm --filter @jobseek/cdk deploy:dev\npnpm --filter @jobseek/cdk deploy:staging\npnpm --filter @jobseek/cdk deploy:prod\n```\n\nEnvironment-specific configuration lives under `cdk/config/` (`dev.json`, `staging.json`, `prod.json`).

The tree is built by pushing operators to the top of the tree, while inserting literals to the lowest free node. Below is an example.  \n**Expression: 5+2\\*6**.   \nInsert: '5':\n![parse-tree](doc-images/parse-tree.jpg?raw=true).   \nInsert: '+': \n![parse-tree](doc-images/parse-tree%20(1).jpg?raw=true).   \nInsert: '2': \n![parse-tree](doc-images/parse-tree%20(2).jpg?raw=true).   \nInsert: '\\*': \n![parse-tree](doc-images/parse-tree%20(3).jpg?raw=true).   \nNow you'll notice the order of expressions is incorrect. To fix this, we simply right rotate the tree:\n![parse-tree](doc-images/parse-tree%20(4).jpg?raw=true).    \nInsert '6':\n![parse-tree](doc-images/parse-tree%20(5).jpg?raw=true).   \n  \n#### Parenthesis\nParenthesis are handled by creating a new tree when an an opening parenthesis is found. When a closing parenthesis is found, the tree returned and evaluated, being inserted back into the tree as a number. Since this is done recursively, nested parenthesis work just fine.\n#### Functions\nWhen a trig function is encountered, it is put into a stack. It is popped from the stack when the next literal is encountered, and the result of function and the literal is inserted into the tree.",

These coordinates do not change as the squares move around the cube since this is helpful during debugging to keep track of how each square is being rotated.\n\n#### Cube State\n\nInitial cube state is created using loops and a helper function, the output looks like this:\n\n```\nconst initialCubeState: CubeState = {\n  U: [\n    [{ color: \"U\", originalCoord: \"0,0\" }, { color: \"U\", originalCoord: \"0,1\" }, { color: \"U\", originalCoord: \"0,2\" }],\n    [{ color: \"U\", originalCoord: \"1,0\" }, { color: \"U\", originalCoord: \"1,1\" }, { color: \"U\", originalCoord: \"1,2\" }],\n    [{ color: \"U\", originalCoord: \"2,0\" }, { color: \"U\", originalCoord: \"2,1\" }, { color: \"U\", originalCoord: \"2,2\" }],\n  ],\n  // Repeat for other faces (L, F, R, B, D)\n};\n```\n\nEach object in the array represents a square and each key a face of the cube.\n\n#### Rotation Logic\n\nThe majority of rotation logic is handled in one `if elseif` statement (if face is 'U', handle accordingly) since each face rotation requires unique transformations to the cubeState data structure. This logic could be refactored to be less redudant and more modular, similar to how parts of the tests are structured.\n\n## Testing\n\n```bash\nnpm run test\n```\n\nI used Jest for testing. There is test coverage for a single rotation of all faces, and for an inverted rotation.\nThe tests are found under `components/__tests__`.\n\n#### Manual testing\n\nCan be proofed using https://rubikscu.be/#simulator\n\n## Running development server\n\nThis is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).\n\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n# or\nyarn dev\n# or\npnpm dev\n# or\nbun dev\n```\n\nOpen [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.\n\n## Build static files and deploy to Github pages\n\n```bash\nnpm run build && npm run deploy\n```",

If you expose contexts to end users, ensure your application filters by both `projectId` and your own user identifier before forwarding requests to Wallcrawler.\n- API keys can be associated with multiple projects. When a key has more than one project, include `x-wc-project-id` on each request to select the target project; the authorizer denies access if the requested project is not in the key's allowlist.\n\n### Data Stores\n\n- **DynamoDB**\n  - `wallcrawler-sessions` — Session metadata, lifecycle history, and connection info.\n  - `wallcrawler-projects` — Project configuration (default timeout, concurrency limits, billing tier).\n  - `wallcrawler-api-keys` — SHA-256 hashed API keys mapped to one or more projects (`projectIds` attribute) with status flags.\n  - `wallcrawler-contexts` — Browser context metadata and S3 object keys. Add per-user ownership metadata in your app if you need user-level isolation.\n- **S3**\n  - `wallcrawler-contexts-*` — Stores compressed Chrome user data directories for persisted contexts.\n\n### API compatibility\n\nWallcrawler provides Browserbase‑compatible APIs and Stagehand endpoints. For exact routes, request/response shapes, and streaming behavior, see:\n\n- docs/api/api-endpoints-reference.md\n- docs/api/sdk-integration-guide.md\n\n### Architecture overview\n\nHigh‑level design, event flows, and data models are covered in the docs referenced above.
