(MongoDB, Express JS, Angular, Node JS)\n## Description\nAudio engineers at NPR like to keep track of all technical difficulties that are encountered during production. Before my\ntime at NPR, the system in place to log incidents was running on an outdated tech-stack and wasn't as elegant as many of the users would have liked. During my internship, it was my job to update and redesign this system to be more capable and user-friendly.\n\nSome of the main features included:\n- Automatic account creation for NPR employees.\n- Searching for logs that fit various criteria.\n- Log creation.\n- Personal subscriptions that send email or text notifications to a specific user when a log that fits certain critiera is submitted.\n- Global subscription that many users can subscribe to at once\n- Automatic I.T. ticket creation.\n- User roles (Administrative abilites, ability to create global subscription, etc.)\n\nThe full documentation of my implementation that I shared with my team can be found in pdf form inside this repo. (It was written in Confluence and upon \nexport has experienced some small formatting errors)\n\n## Screenshots\n![search](/screenshots/AED-sheets_screenshot1.png)\n![profile](/screenshots/AED-sheets_screenshot2.png)\n![manage lookups](/screenshots/AED-sheets_screenshot3.png)",

The tree is built by pushing operators to the top of the tree, while inserting literals to the lowest free node. Below is an example.  \n**Expression: 5+2\\*6**.   \nInsert: '5':\n![parse-tree](doc-images/parse-tree.jpg?raw=true).   \nInsert: '+': \n![parse-tree](doc-images/parse-tree%20(1).jpg?raw=true).   \nInsert: '2': \n![parse-tree](doc-images/parse-tree%20(2).jpg?raw=true).   \nInsert: '\\*': \n![parse-tree](doc-images/parse-tree%20(3).jpg?raw=true).   \nNow you'll notice the order of expressions is incorrect. To fix this, we simply right rotate the tree:\n![parse-tree](doc-images/parse-tree%20(4).jpg?raw=true).    \nInsert '6':\n![parse-tree](doc-images/parse-tree%20(5).jpg?raw=true).   \n  \n#### Parenthesis\nParenthesis are handled by creating a new tree when an an opening parenthesis is found. When a closing parenthesis is found, the tree returned and evaluated, being inserted back into the tree as a number. Since this is done recursively, nested parenthesis work just fine.\n#### Functions\nWhen a trig function is encountered, it is put into a stack. It is popped from the stack when the next literal is encountered, and the result of function and the literal is inserted into the tree.",

The runtime will error at startup if any required model is missing after those fallbacks.\n\n### Operations\n\nOperational guides and troubleshooting resources:\n\n- **[Log Diving](docs/operations/log-diving.md)** – Guide to finding and analyzing CloudWatch logs for Lambda functions\n\n## About\n\nFull-stack Next.js 15 portfolio with an AI-powered chat assistant, blog CMS, and GitHub project integration. Built as a TypeScript monorepo with domain-isolated packages. Deployed to AWS using CDK and OpenNext.\n\n## Monorepo Structure\n\nThis workspace uses pnpm workspaces to organize domain logic into focused packages:\n\n### Core Application\n\n- **`src/`** – Next.js 15 App Router application (pages, API routes, components, hooks, server actions)\n- **`infra/cdk/`** – AWS CDK infrastructure stack (CloudFront, Lambda@Edge, DynamoDB, S3, alarms)\n\n### Chat Packages\n\n- **`@portfolio/chat-contract`** – Shared TypeScript types and schemas for chat API contracts\n- **`@portfolio/chat-data`** – Data access layer: project/resume/profile repositories, BM25 + semantic search\n- **`@portfolio/chat-next-api`** – Server-side chat API: streaming SSE, embeddings, cost metrics, debug logging\n- **`@portfolio/chat-next-ui`** – React components and hooks: `ChatProvider`, `useChat`, streaming state management\n- **`@portfolio/chat-orchestrator`** – Core chat pipeline: planner → retrieval → answer with prompt templates\n- **`@portfolio/chat-preprocess-cli`** – CLI for preprocessing chat data (project knowledge, resume parsing, embeddings)\n\n### Utilities\n\n- **`@portfolio/github-data`** – GitHub API integration for fetching repository metadata\n\nAll packages are built with TypeScript and share a common `tsconfig.json` base. See individual package READMEs for usage details:\n\n- [`packages/chat-preprocess-cli/README.md`](packages/chat-preprocess-cli/README.md)\n- [`packages/chat-next-ui/README.md`](packages/chat-next-ui/README.md)\n\n## Quick Start\n\n```bash\n# Install dependencies\npnpm install\n\n# Run development server\npnpm dev\n```\n\nOpen [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the site.\n\n### Chat Data Preprocess\n\nThe AI chat experience relies on precomputed repo knowledge, resume data, and profile metadata. Set `GH_TOKEN`, `PORTFOLIO_GIST_ID`, and `OPENAI_API_KEY`, then run:\n\n```bash\npnpm chat:preprocess\n```\n\nThis orchestrates every ingestion step (project summaries + embeddings, resume parser, profile builder) and writes refreshed artifacts to `generated/` (`projects.json`, `projects-embeddings.json`, `resume.json`, `resume-embeddings.json`, `profile.json`).\nInputs you need in the repo: `data/chat/profile.json` and a resume PDF at `public/resume/` (defaults to `resume.filename` in `chat-preprocess.config.yml`, falling back to `resume.pdf` when omitted). The raw resume JSON now defaults to `generated/resume-raw.json` and is produced from the PDF, so you don't need to check in `data/chat/resume.json` unless you want to supply a handcrafted source via `paths.resumeJson`. Persona output is now static and comes directly from `profile.json` fields (`systemPersona`, `shortAbout`, `styleGuidelines`, `voiceExamples`).\n\n## Ask My Portfolio (Chat)\n\nThe chat experience runs on a multi-stage orchestrator pipeline:\n\n- **Planner → Retrieval → Answer** pipeline in `packages/chat-orchestrator`; UI is derived from AnswerPayload.uiHints, never directly from retrieval.\n- **Retrieval** is in-process BM25 + embeddings over the precomputed snapshots in `generated/` (projects, resume, profile) loaded via `src/server/chat/dataProviders.ts`; no external vector DB.\n- **Streaming** via `/api/chat` route emits SSE events (`stage`, `reasoning`, `ui`, `token`, `item`, `attachment`, `ui_actions`, `done`, `error`) using `@portfolio/chat-next-api`; the front-end consumes them through `ChatProvider` from `@portfolio/chat-next-ui`.\n- **Answer payload** is structured JSON: the Answer stage streams `AnswerPayload.message` tokens and also returns optional `thoughts` for dev-only reasoning.\n- **Configuration** supports model overrides, token limits, semantic ranking weights, and debug levels (see [config-notes.md](docs/features/chat/config-notes.md)).\n- **Observability** includes structured logging with correlation IDs, CloudWatch integration, cost metrics, and local debug export (see [chat-logging.md](docs/features/chat/chat-logging.md)).\n- **Safety** enforces rate limits (5/min, 40/hr, 120/day) that fail-closed and a $10/month runtime cost alarm with warning/critical/exceeded thresholds for planner/answer + embedding calls (see [rate-limits-and-cost-guards.md](docs/features/chat/rate-limits-and-cost-guards.md)).\n\nDetailed prompts, JSON schemas, and UI contract examples live in [docs/features/chat/chat-spec.md](docs/features/chat/chat-spec.md).\n\n## Testing\n\nThe test suite uses Playwright for both E2E behavioral tests and integration tests against real services.\n\n### Quick Commands\n\n```bash\n# Run E2E tests (fast, deterministic fixtures)\npnpm test\n\n# Run integration tests (real AWS/GitHub/OpenAI)\npnpm test:real-api\n\n# Interactive development\npnpm test:ui\n\n# View test report\npnpm test:report\n```\n\n### Test Architecture\n\n- **E2E Tests** (`site-flows.spec.ts`, `engagement.spec.ts`) – Fast, fixture-based tests for UI behavior\n- **Integration Tests** (`api-integration.spec.ts`) – Real service verification (costs money, sends real emails)\n- **Unified Testing** – Same Playwright setup supports both modes via `E2E_USE_REAL_APIS` flag\n\nSee [e2e/README.md](e2e/README.md) for complete testing guide, authoring guidelines, and CI/CD integration details.\n\n## Scripts & Tools\n\n### Environment Sync\n\nKeep GitHub environments and AWS Secrets Manager aligned with annotated `.env.*` files:\n\n```bash\n# Sync local dev environment\npnpm sync:local\n\n# Sync production (GitHub + AWS)\npnpm sync:prod\n```\n\nSee [scripts/README.md](scripts/README.md) for complete documentation on environment sync, chat evaluation tools, and export utilities.\n\n### Chat Data Preprocessing\n\nGenerate embeddings and knowledge artifacts for the chat system:\n\n```bash\n# Full preprocessing pipeline\npnpm chat:preprocess\n\n# Profile generation only\npnpm chat:preprocess:profile\n\n# Run chat evaluations\npnpm chat:evals\n```\n\nSee [`packages/chat-preprocess-cli/README.md`](packages/chat-preprocess-cli/README.md) for configuration options.\n\n## Deployment\n\nThe site deploys to AWS using CDK and OpenNext. See the [CDK Stack Guide](docs/architecture/cdk.md) for full deployment instructions.\n\n### Quick Deploy\n\n```bash\n# Build Next.js artifacts\npnpm run build:web\n\n# Deploy to AWS (must be us-east-1 for Lambda@Edge)\ncd infra/cdk\nexport CDK_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1\nexport CDK_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT=<your-account-id>\npnpm cdk deploy\n```\n\n### CI/CD\n\nGitHub Actions automatically deploys on `main` branch pushes:\n\n1. **Pre-deployment**: E2E tests with fixtures (fast safety check)\n2. **Deploy**: CDK stack to AWS\n3. **Post-deployment**: Integration tests with real services\n\nSee [CDK Stack Guide](docs/architecture/cdk.md) for required secrets and environment variables.",

These coordinates do not change as the squares move around the cube since this is helpful during debugging to keep track of how each square is being rotated.\n\n#### Cube State\n\nInitial cube state is created using loops and a helper function, the output looks like this:\n\n```\nconst initialCubeState: CubeState = {\n  U: [\n    [{ color: \"U\", originalCoord: \"0,0\" }, { color: \"U\", originalCoord: \"0,1\" }, { color: \"U\", originalCoord: \"0,2\" }],\n    [{ color: \"U\", originalCoord: \"1,0\" }, { color: \"U\", originalCoord: \"1,1\" }, { color: \"U\", originalCoord: \"1,2\" }],\n    [{ color: \"U\", originalCoord: \"2,0\" }, { color: \"U\", originalCoord: \"2,1\" }, { color: \"U\", originalCoord: \"2,2\" }],\n  ],\n  // Repeat for other faces (L, F, R, B, D)\n};\n```\n\nEach object in the array represents a square and each key a face of the cube.\n\n#### Rotation Logic\n\nThe majority of rotation logic is handled in one `if elseif` statement (if face is 'U', handle accordingly) since each face rotation requires unique transformations to the cubeState data structure. This logic could be refactored to be less redudant and more modular, similar to how parts of the tests are structured.\n\n## Testing\n\n```bash\nnpm run test\n```\n\nI used Jest for testing. There is test coverage for a single rotation of all faces, and for an inverted rotation.\nThe tests are found under `components/__tests__`.\n\n#### Manual testing\n\nCan be proofed using https://rubikscu.be/#simulator\n\n## Running development server\n\nThis is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).\n\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n# or\nyarn dev\n# or\npnpm dev\n# or\nbun dev\n```\n\nOpen [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.\n\n## Build static files and deploy to Github pages\n\n```bash\nnpm run build && npm run deploy\n```",

This monorepo contains the infrastructure, backend services, SDK, and UI components to run Wallcrawler in your own AWS account.\n\n### Quick links\n\n- **Architecture**: [docs/infra/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/infra/ARCHITECTURE.md)\n- **Event Systems**: [docs/infra/EVENT_SYSTEMS_ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/infra/EVENT_SYSTEMS_ARCHITECTURE.md)\n- **DynamoDB Schema**: [docs/infra/DYNAMODB_SCHEMA.md](docs/infra/DYNAMODB_SCHEMA.md)\n- **Multi‑Arch Docker**: [docs/infra/MULTI_ARCH_DOCKER_SOLUTION.md](docs/infra/MULTI_ARCH_DOCKER_SOLUTION.md)\n- **Deployment Guide**: [docs/deploy/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](docs/deploy/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)\n- **API Endpoints Reference**: [docs/api/api-endpoints-reference.md](docs/api/api-endpoints-reference.md)\n- **SDK Integration Guide**: [docs/api/sdk-integration-guide.md](docs/api/sdk-integration-guide.md)\n- **Sessions**:\n  - JWT Signing Key Flow: [docs/api/sessions/jwt-signing-key-flow.md](docs/api/sessions/jwt-signing-key-flow.md)\n  - Container Lifecycle: [docs/api/sessions/wallcrawler-container-lifecycle.md](docs/api/sessions/wallcrawler-container-lifecycle.md)\n  - CloudWatch Logging Best Practices: [docs/api/sessions/cloudwatch-logging-best-practices.md](docs/api/sessions/cloudwatch-logging-best-practices.md)\n\n### Packages\n\n- `@wallcrawler/aws-cdk` — AWS CDK app defining all infrastructure (API Gateway, Lambda, ECS/Fargate, EventBridge, DynamoDB, Redis, etc.)\n  - Source: [packages/aws-cdk/](packages/aws-cdk/)\n  - See: [docs/infra/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/infra/ARCHITECTURE.md) and [docs/deploy/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](docs/deploy/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)\n\n- `@wallcrawler/backend-go` — Go Lambda handlers and services for SDK‑compatible endpoints and orchestration\n  - Source: [packages/backend-go/](packages/backend-go/)\n  - README: [packages/backend-go/README.md](packages/backend-go/README.md)\n\n- `@wallcrawler/sdk-node` — TypeScript/Node client for Wallcrawler’s REST API (Browserbase‑compatible)\n  - Source: [packages/sdk-node/](packages/sdk-node/)\n  - README: [packages/sdk-node/README.md](packages/sdk-node/README.md)\n  - API: [packages/sdk-node/api.md](packages/sdk-node/api.md)\n\n- `@wallcrawler/stagehand` — Stagehand fork used by Wallcrawler for LLM‑powered browsing\n  - Source: [packages/stagehand/](packages/stagehand/)\n  - README: [packages/stagehand/README.md](packages/stagehand/README.md)\n\n- `@wallcrawler/components` — UI components (e.g., `BrowserViewport`) for embedding live sessions\n  - Source: [packages/components/](packages/components/)\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Node.js >= 18 and pnpm >= 8\n- Go >= 1.21 (for backend)\n- AWS CLI configured for your target account\n- Docker (for local builds and multi‑arch images)\n\n### Getting started\n\n```bash\n# 1) Initialize submodules (if any)\npnpm install:submodules\n\n# 2) Install dependencies\npnpm install\n\n# 3) Build everything\npnpm build\n\n# 4) Generate local env (CDK helpers)\npnpm generate-env\n\n# 5) Deploy (see Deployment Guide for environments/config)\npnpm deploy\n```\n\nAdditional scripts:\n\n- Lint: `pnpm lint`\n- Tests: `pnpm test`\n- Dev (package‑scoped): `pnpm -r dev`\n- CDK Toolkit: `pnpm cdk`\n\n### Configuration\n\nThe backend reads several environment variables at runtime:\n\n- `WALLCRAWLER_MAX_SESSION_TIMEOUT` — Maximum allowed session duration in seconds (defaults to 3600).\n- `PROJECTS_TABLE_NAME`, `API_KEYS_TABLE_NAME`, `CONTEXTS_TABLE_NAME` — Automatically injected by the CDK stack for the Lambda functions.\n- `CONTEXTS_BUCKET_NAME` — S3 bucket that stores browser context archives for persisted sessions.\n- `SESSIONS_TABLE_NAME` — Sessions table (`wallcrawler-sessions` by default).\n- Contexts (browser profiles) remain project-scoped. If you expose contexts to end users, ensure your application filters by both `projectId` and your own user identifier before forwarding requests to Wallcrawler.\n- API keys can be associated with multiple projects. When a key has more than one project, include `x-wc-project-id` on each request to select the target project; the authorizer denies access if the requested project is not in the key's allowlist.\n\n### Data Stores\n\n- **DynamoDB**\n  - `wallcrawler-sessions` — Session metadata, lifecycle history, and connection info.\n  - `wallcrawler-projects` — Project configuration (default timeout, concurrency limits, billing tier).\n  - `wallcrawler-api-keys` — SHA-256 hashed API keys mapped to one or more projects (`projectIds` attribute) with status flags.\n  - `wallcrawler-contexts` — Browser context metadata and S3 object keys. Add per-user ownership metadata in your app if you need user-level isolation.\n- **S3**\n  - `wallcrawler-contexts-*` — Stores compressed Chrome user data directories for persisted contexts.\n\n### API compatibility\n\nWallcrawler provides Browserbase‑compatible APIs and Stagehand endpoints. For exact routes, request/response shapes, and streaming behavior, see:\n\n- docs/api/api-endpoints-reference.md\n- docs/api/sdk-integration-guide.md\n\n### Architecture overview\n\nHigh‑level design, event flows, and data models are covered in the docs referenced above.
