## Chat vs. SSR Data Caching

- **SSR routes (`/projects`, `/projects/[pid]`, etc.)** pull portfolio data on the server via helpers in `src/lib/github-server.ts`, which use Next.js `unstable_cache` (s-maxage 1h) for repo lists, readmes, and docs. That cache lives only on the server edge/runtime.
- **Chat experience (`src/components/chat/*`)** runs entirely on the client, so we maintain a separate React Query cache via `ChatQueryProvider`. Hooks such as `useProjectListCache`, `useRepoReadme`, `useRepoDocument`, and `useAssetPrefetch` keep project lists, readmes, docs, and images warm inside the browser session.
- The home page now hydrates the chat QueryClient with the SSR-fetched project list **and** preloads the READMEs for the top project cards before delivering the dehydrated cache to the browser. First clicks on those repos therefore render instantly with zero extra API work.
- Remaining resources (filtered repo sets, long-tail readmes, docs, assets) still rely on client-side fetching, so there can still be divergence if those surfaces werenâ€™t part of the initial hydration. Achieving full parity would mean hydrating every server-fetched payload (e.g., via `dehydrate` on project/doc routes) or converging both surfaces on the same data-fetching path.***
